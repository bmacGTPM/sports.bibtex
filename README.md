For each citation, the citation key has the form 

`lastnameYYYYkeyword`

where 

- `lastname` is the last name of the first author, 
- `YYYY` is the 4 digit year of the publication date
- `keyword` is a keyword that distinguishes that from other papers by that author

The citation key is the citation name that will be used with `[@citationkey]` in an `.rmd` paper and `\cite{citationkey}` in a `.tex` paper.

Citations are listed in (roughly) alphabetical order.
