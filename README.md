# sportsBibTeX
A BibTeX file, `bibliography.bib`, with sports analytics references to be used in academic journal articles or otherwise.  Contributions from the community are strongly encouraged. 

For each citation, the citation key has one of the following two forms

- `lastnameYYYYfirstword` or 
- `lastnameYYYYkeyword`

where 

- `lastname` is the last name of the first author, 
- `YYYY` is the 4 digit year of the publication date
- `firstword` is the first word of the title
- `keyword` is a keyword that distinguishes that from other papers by that author

The citation key is the citation name that will be used with `[@citationkey]` in an `.rmd` paper and `\cite{citationkey}` in a `.tex` paper. 

The default citation key from Google Scholar, for example, is `lastnameYYYYfirstword`.  However, contributors may choose to change the default to using a `keyword` that is more memorable and use `lastnameYYYYkeyword`. For example, the default on Google Scholar for [this paper](http://statsportsconsulting.com/main/wp-content/uploads/Schuckers_Curro_MIT_Sloan_THoR.pdf) is `schuckers2013total`, but has been changed to `schuckers2013thor`. 

Note that you can get BibTeX citations on Google Scholar by searching for an author or article at https://scholar.google.com/ and clicking the quotation marks and "BibTeX" as shown here:
